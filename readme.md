# GiveLive — Real-Location Smart Fundraising Platform  
**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**  
Version: 1.0

---

## 📌 Overview

GiveLive is a web app + real-location service that turns real-time scanner engagement into donations through QR-driven journeys. At any real location, the organizer displays a QR code. Scanners scan it and begin a dynamic storytelling funnel leading to giving.

GiveLive uses a *visual automation tree* (like Mailchimp’s customer journey builder) to create personalized multi-step donor funnels that may include videos, text messages, follow-up content, and final donation asks.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Convert anonymous scanners at real locations into segmented donors.
- Build real-time storytelling funnels starting from a single QR scan.
- Allow organizers to design a multi-step, branching, personalized donor journey.
- Optimize donor conversion with analytics and per-node tracking.
- Support follow-up after the visit via text and dynamic pages.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. **Real-Location QR System**

A visual “flow builder” with node types:
- **Page Node**

- **End Node**

Each node creates a hosted mini-page with analytics.

- Branching logic based on:
  - Link clicks
  - Form submissions
  - Video watch %
  - Time-based actions
