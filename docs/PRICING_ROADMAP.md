## Phase 5 — AI Follow-Up Assistant (+$29/mo)

**Positioning:** Upsell add-on on any paid plan (not tied to QR count).

| Capability | Status | Implementation notes |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| Auto follow-up emails | 🔲 | Extend `email.ts` + journey triggers on lead capture |
| Draft SMS messages | 🔲 | OpenAI on `MessageNodeEditor` + approval queue |
| Lead scoring | 🔲 | Rules + LLM score from form fields / behavior |
| CRM notes | 🔲 | Push to HubSpot/FUB activity via `IntegrationService` |
| Settings toggle | 🔲 | `ai_followup_enabled` on org |
| Billing add-on | 🔲 | Stripe subscription item `price_ai_followup` |

**MVP slice (recommended order)**

1. Lead capture → AI-drafted thank-you email (human can edit template)
2. Lead score 1–100 stored on `users.metadata`
3. Optional auto-send after 5 min delay if add-on active

## Open questions

1. **Campaign** = one `event` / flow in the dashboard — confirm naming in UI ("campaign" vs "flow").
2. **Lead** = one `users` row or one `form_submissions` row — recommend unique contact per org per month.
3. **Annual billing** — 2 months free? (not in v1 copy).
4. **Trial** — 14-day on Starter/Growth before card?
